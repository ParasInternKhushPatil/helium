 |      time_usec                 : Timestamp (UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot). The receiving end can infer timestamp format (since 1.1.1970 or since system boot) by checking for the magnitude the number. [us] (type:uint64_t)
 |      group_mlx                 : Actuator group. The "_mlx" indicates this is a multi-instance message and a MAVLink parser should use this field to difference between instances. (type:uint8_t)
 |      controls                  : Actuator controls. Normed to -1..+1 where 0 is neutral position. Throttle for single rotation direction motors is 0..1, negative range for reverse direction. Standard mapping for attitude controls (group 0): (index 0-7): roll, pitch, yaw, throttle, flaps, spoilers, airbrakes, landing gear. Load a pass-through mixer to repurpose them as generic outputs.

It generally should max out at the maximum range of e.g. the laser altimeter. It is generally a moving target. A negative value indicates no measurement available. [m] (type:float)

 |      procedures autonomously. After a failure occurred it
 |      should first move from active to critical to allow
